We are testing a path of <strong>&quot;symbiosis between commerce and open source.&quot;</strong></p><p>Our logic is simple: <strong>Survive, make money, and then do open source with more confidence.</strong></p><p>Only when TechUI has a stable source of income (through Prime licensing, customized services, etc.) can we calmly invest energy into maintaining documentation, optimizing core algorithms, and gradually releasing more free resources to the community.</p><h2 id="progressive-commitment" tabindex="-1">Progressive Commitment <a class="header-anchor" href="#progressive-commitment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Progressive Commitment&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Based on the above philosophy, we have formulated the following <strong>Progressive Open Source</strong> strategy:</p><h3 id="🤝-contribution-is-open-source" tabindex="-1">🤝 Contribution is Open Source <a class="header-anchor" href="#🤝-contribution-is-open-source" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🤝 Contribution is Open Source&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We promise: <strong>Originating from the community, returning to the community.</strong></p><ul><li>All code contributed by community developers and accepted after review (whether components, layouts, or utility functions) will be directly incorporated into the <strong>MIT licensed</strong> open-source component library after obtaining the consent of the original author.</li><li>These fruits of wisdom created together by everyone will be free forever and will never be subject to secondary charges.</li></ul><h3 id="🔄-synchronous-open-source-plan" tabindex="-1">🔄 Synchronous Open Source Plan <a class="header-anchor" href="#🔄-synchronous-open-source-plan" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🔄 Synchronous Open Source Plan&quot;">​</a></h3><p>TechUI is committed to building a virtuous cycle of the open-source ecosystem. While community developers continuously enrich the component library, the official team will also follow up synchronously:</p><ul><li><strong>Regular Review</strong>: We will regularly organize and evaluate the officially maintained <strong>&quot;Base Components.&quot;</strong></li><li><strong>Gradual Opening</strong>: We will gradually incorporate Base components verified by production environments into the blueprint of the <code>TechUI Open Source Library</code>.</li><li><strong>Growing Together</strong>: This is a dynamic balancing process.

But as of now, TechUI <strong>remains the result of one person&#39;s battle.</strong></p><p>In these years that have passed like a single day, there have been no shifts and no substitutes. The author sacrificed almost all spare time and holidays to exchange for today&#39;s massive system engineering. This is a challenge where the workload grows exponentially; the hardships involved are known only to the late-night code and solitude.</p><p>Someone once advised me: &quot;Be generous and open-source all the code; it will be good for the industry.&quot; This kind of suggestion sounds beautiful, but it often overlooks a premise: <strong>Do not advise others to be kind without having suffered their hardships.</strong></p><p>For those who do not need to write code personally and do not need to bear the pressure of maintenance, &quot;generosity&quot; only requires moving their lips. But for TechUI, this means asking an individual to sacrifice years of life, time, and painstaking effort for free.
