The Prime component library comes with a built-in <strong>fully functional trial mode</strong>. When no license is configured:</p><ul><li><strong>Full Features</strong>: You can experience all functionalities of Prime, including 3D components and convenient chart components, without any feature stripping.</li><li><strong>Unlimited Refreshes</strong>: The trial mode only has a single session duration limit (usually 10 minutes). After the countdown ends, you only need to <strong>refresh the page</strong> to reset the timer and continue debugging. This means you can completely finish the development of an entire Demo in your local development environment for free.</li></ul><h3 id="🆓-free-for-commercial-use-independent-components" tabindex="-1">🆓 Free for Commercial Use (Independent Components) <a class="header-anchor" href="#🆓-free-for-commercial-use-independent-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🆓 Free for Commercial Use (Independent Components)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We always maintain respect for the free spirit.
