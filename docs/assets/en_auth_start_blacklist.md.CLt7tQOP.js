Once a license is listed on the blacklist, it cannot be restored by any means, and the license will permanently become invalid in all new versions of TechUI.</p><h2 id="technical-limitations" tabindex="-1">Technical Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Technical Limitations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We are committed to maintaining technical transparency. We must acknowledge that as a Pure Frontend component library, TechUI&#39;s operating mechanism relies on <strong>&#39;Client Runtime&#39;</strong> and <strong>&#39;Local Execution&#39;</strong> architectural characteristics. This means our blacklist mechanism has physically &quot;untouchable&quot; areas.</p><h3 id="untouchable-existing-business" tabindex="-1">&quot;Untouchable&quot; Existing Business <a class="header-anchor" href="#untouchable-existing-business" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&quot;Untouchable&quot; Existing Business&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Because we cannot remotely control or rollback static resources you have already deployed to users&#39; browsers, <strong>the blacklist mechanism has a lag</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Existing Availability</strong>: Even if blacklisted, projects compiled, packaged, and deployed using older versions of TechUI <strong>remain available</strong>. We cannot remotely shut them down.</li><li><strong>Limited Sanctions</strong>: In a sense, the blacklist serves more as a severe &quot;warning record&quot;.</li></ul><h3 id="the-real-punishment-cutting-off-the-future" tabindex="-1">The Real Punishment: Cutting Off the Future <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-real-punishment-cutting-off-the-future" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Real Punishment: Cutting Off the Future&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Although older versions remain available, &quot;entering the blacklist&quot; means your project will <strong>permanently lose future possibilities</strong>. This is the real punishment of this mechanism:</p><ul><li><strong>Version Stagnation</strong>: You will be unable to upgrade to any new TechUI versions containing new features, performance optimizations, or security patches.</li><li><strong>Technical Debt</strong>: When you attempt to upgrade dependencies, the Wasm core&#39;s meltdown mechanism will trigger, causing the project to fail to run properly. (Of course, you can rollback to the old version.)</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Summary</strong>: TechUI&#39;s blacklist mechanism does not seek to &quot;destroy the past&quot; but aims to &quot;blockade the future&quot;. Any team attempting to maintain the project lifecycle evolution cannot afford the cost of losing version updates.</p></blockquote><h2 id="violations" tabindex="-1">Violations <a class="header-anchor" href="#violations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Violations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When any of the following behaviors are monitored or confirmed via reporting, the relevant license will be immediately marked as &quot;High Risk&quot; or directly listed on the blacklist:</p><h3 id="license-leakage-and-misappropriation" tabindex="-1">License Leakage and Misappropriation <a class="header-anchor" href="#license-leakage-and-misappropriation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;License Leakage and Misappropriation&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Due to improper custody, the License Key leaks to the public network (such as GitHub public repositories, technical forums, QQ/TG groups, etc.).</li><li>Lending, transferring, or reselling a license restricted to own use to a third party.</li></ul><h3 id="geo-violation" tabindex="-1">Geo-Violation <a class="header-anchor" href="#geo-violation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Geo-Violation&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>When a license is issued, it is limited to use in the registered country or region.
