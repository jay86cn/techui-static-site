At that time, the market lacked Vue big-screen components that were both beautiful and easy to use. To meet the requirements, I performed secondary development based on the open-source library <code>@jiaminghi/data-view</code>.</p><ul><li><strong>Outcome</strong>: Completed the first version for personal use. Although it lacked system design and felt cobbled together, it barely solved the problem of &quot;making it not just usable, but also good-looking.&quot;</li><li><strong>Accumulation</strong>: Gained a deep understanding of dynamic SVG path calculation mechanisms, laying the foundation for the later Scifi style.</li></ul><h3 id="🛡️-2021-the-barrier" tabindex="-1">🛡️ 2021: The Barrier <a class="header-anchor" href="#🛡️-2021-the-barrier" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🛡️ 2021: The Barrier&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Keywords</strong>: <code>Digital Cube</code> · <code>i18n</code> · <code>JS Encryption</code></p></blockquote><p>To protect the fruits of my labor, I began exploring frontend authorization mechanisms and named the component library &quot;Digital Cube&quot; (Shuzi Mofang).</p><ul><li><strong>Technical Attempt</strong>: Designed the first-generation theme system and introduced i18n internationalization support.</li><li><strong>First Commercialization</strong>: Developed the first frontend licensing feature using JS obfuscation and encryption.
