As a typical <strong>pragmatist</strong>, my learning goals were very specific—mastering just enough to develop WASM—without delving deeply into the language&#39;s advanced features. During that stage, when AI-assisted programming was not yet mature, I did spend a significant amount of time on trial and error and debugging. Today, using AI for WASM development should be much simpler and easier.</p><p>I share this experience hoping to help everyone <strong>break through the &quot;fear of Rust&quot;</strong>. Do not feel that you must master this language before you can start working. Learn with a goal in mind, and you can easily cross this threshold.</p></div>',4))])}const v=a(c,[["render",h]]);export{k as __pageData,v as default};
