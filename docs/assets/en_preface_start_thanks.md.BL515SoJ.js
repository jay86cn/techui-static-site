The author views themselves as a technology <strong>&quot;Integrator,&quot;</strong> forging countless scattered modules into a new, living entity. While it contains many pioneering and original ideas, it is, more importantly, built upon the shoulders of giants—performing deep iterations and enhancements on existing technologies.</p><p>None of this would have been possible without the powerful empowerment of AI. Relying on the author&#39;s strength alone, it would have been impossible to construct such a massive, systemic engineering feat. For creators, this is undoubtedly the best of times—even the smallest spark of an idea can leverage the dividends of the era to manifest into a grand reality that was once unimaginable.</p><p>With this work, TechUI expresses gratitude for this gift of the era.</p><p>We sincerely thank all the individuals, teams, and artificial intelligences that provided inspiration, foundations, and productivity for TechUI.</p><h2 id="ai-partners" tabindex="-1">AI Partners <a class="header-anchor" href="#ai-partners" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;AI Partners&quot;">​</a></h2><p>TechUI adopted a unique <strong>&quot;Human + AI&quot;</strong> hybrid development model.
