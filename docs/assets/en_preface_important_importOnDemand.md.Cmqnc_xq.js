However, based on its unique technical architecture and product positioning, TechUI <strong>decided from the outset not to support on-demand import</strong>.</p><p>This is a counter-intuitive but well-considered decision. The following are the core reasons why we abandoned this feature.</p><h2 id="architectural-limitations" tabindex="-1">Architectural Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#architectural-limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Architectural Limitations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The core of TechUI is not a set of scattered JavaScript files, but a compiled <strong>WebAssembly (Rust)</strong> binary module.</p><ul><li><strong>Dynamic Computation Dependencies</strong>: More than 90% of the SVG paths, sci-fi dynamic effects, and 3D posture calculations in TechUI are generated in real-time by the Wasm module at runtime through mathematical formulas, rather than static SVG files.</li><li><strong>Indivisible Binary</strong>: A Wasm module is similar to a compiled <code>.exe</code> or <code>.so</code> library file. You cannot &quot;import half of the binary code&quot; like splitting JS code. To ensure the complete operation of core algorithms (such as the <code>TEMPLATE</code> engine and <code>ENC</code> encryption), the entire Wasm core must be loaded.</li></ul><h2 id="commercial-protection" tabindex="-1">Commercial Protection <a class="header-anchor" href="#commercial-protection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Commercial Protection&quot;">​</a></h2><p>TechUI is a <strong>commercially closed-source</strong> component library, not an open-source community project.</p><ul><li><strong>Packaging as Protection</strong>: Supporting &quot;on-demand import&quot; usually means publishing unpackaged source code (ESM) and allowing build tools to analyze the code dependency tree. This would directly expose our core implementation logic.</li><li><strong>Anti-Reverse Engineering</strong>: To protect intellectual property, we perform deep packaging and obfuscation on all components before release. This &quot;full package release&quot; strategy is the first line of defense for the anti-tamper mechanism.</li></ul><h2 id="development-philosophy" tabindex="-1">Development Philosophy <a class="header-anchor" href="#development-philosophy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Development Philosophy&quot;">​</a></h2><p>TechUI was designed to serve <strong>high-intensity enterprise-level development</strong> scenarios (such as outsourced delivery and urgent large-screen projects). We believe that the <strong>value of a developer&#39;s time</strong> is much higher than the <strong>bandwidth cost</strong> for users.</p><ul><li><strong>Batteries Included</strong>: We promote the &quot;full registration&quot; model. Developers do not need to repeatedly import every icon or component on every page.</li><li>❌ <strong>Cumbersome</strong>: <code>import { TuiButton, TuiIconUser, ... } from ...</code></li><li>✅ <strong>Efficient</strong>: After <code>app.use(TechUI)</code>, you can use <code>&lt;TuiButton /&gt;</code> directly anywhere.</li><li><strong>Flow Experience</strong>: When building complex large screens, not having to interrupt your thoughts to find and configure component references just to save a few KB significantly improves the developer&#39;s flow experience.</li></ul><h2 id="performance-dialectics" tabindex="-1">Performance Dialectics <a class="header-anchor" href="#performance-dialectics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Performance Dialectics&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For the B2B / G2B (government/enterprise) application scenarios served by TechUI, we focus the optimization of <strong>first-screen loading speed</strong> on &quot;network environment&quot; and &quot;caching strategy&quot; rather than just package size.</p><ul><li><strong>Bandwidth Redundancy</strong>: In today&#39;s era of 4G/5G and widespread fiber optics, loading an 800KB+ Wasm package (even smaller after Gzip) usually takes only a few hundred milliseconds. Sacrificing development efficiency to save dozens of KB is considered over-optimization in modern network environments.</li><li><strong>Long-term Caching</strong>: Once the Wasm module and component library code are loaded, they are strongly cached by the browser. For internal enterprise systems (Intranet) or high-frequency large-screen systems, users only need to download resources on their first visit; subsequent visits incur <strong>zero network overhead</strong>.</li><li><strong>Streaming Compilation</strong>: Thanks to Wasm&#39;s Streaming Compilation feature, its parsing and execution speed are much faster than JavaScript code of the same size, so the actual &quot;Time to Interactive (TTI)&quot; is not significantly delayed by a large package size.</li></ul><p>This is an excellent analogy. By citing well-known operating systems and software, it powerfully demonstrates that &quot;redundancy&quot; in engineering design often represents &quot;capacity reserves&quot; and &quot;system robustness,&quot; rather than simply being a burden.</p><p>I have significantly expanded upon the original &quot;Pareto Principle&quot; section, incorporating the examples of iPhone, Windows, and Android that you requested, making it a highly persuasive chapter.</p><h2 id="redundancy-philosophy" tabindex="-1">Redundancy Philosophy <a class="header-anchor" href="#redundancy-philosophy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Redundancy Philosophy&quot;">​</a></h2><p>TechUI follows the reverse thinking of the &quot;Pareto Principle&quot;: <strong>Although 80% of users may only use 20% of the functions, we cannot predict which specific 20% those will be.</strong></p><p>In software engineering, &quot;comprehensive&quot; design is often misunderstood as bloated, but it actually represents <strong>&quot;Capability Completeness.&quot;</strong> Top-tier digital products we use daily practice this philosophy:</p><ul><li><strong>📱 iPhone / Android Systems</strong>: Your mobile operating system easily takes up 10GB+ of space. It includes LiDAR drivers, accessibility features (VoiceOver), and dozens of foreign language fonts you may never use. <strong>Why not delete them?</strong> Because when you occasionally need to scan a QR code or adjust a font size, the system must <strong>respond immediately</strong> instead of prompting you to &quot;download a module&quot;.</li><li><strong>💻 Windows / macOS</strong>: Operating systems come pre-installed with tens of thousands of printer drivers and general hardware interfaces, even if you only have one printer. The value lies in <strong>&quot;Plug and Play&quot;</strong> when you connect a new device. TechUI&#39;s full import is also to allow developers to <strong>write and use</strong> a chart immediately when needed.</li><li><strong>🌐 Complex SaaS / Website Functions</strong>: Consider Microsoft Excel or Photoshop. Most users only master 5% of their functions (like summation or cropping) in their lifetime. The key point is that the remaining 95% is not redundant because <strong>the &quot;5%&quot; needed by each user is different</strong>. Only by providing 100% of the feature set can the &quot;individual 5%&quot; of everyone be met.</li></ul><p><strong>The same applies to TechUI Prime.</strong> Because we pre-install the full code, you only need to change one line of configuration to achieve a result, without reconfiguring build tools, troubleshooting dependency conflicts, or downloading new plugins.</p><p><strong>Redundancy is sometimes the greatest convenience.</strong></p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">📦 Size Note</p><p>Currently, the Gzip compressed size of TechUI Prime (including the Wasm core) is approximately <strong>1MB ~ 2MB</strong> (depending on the version). In a modern enterprise-level broadband environment, this is within a completely acceptable range.</p></div>',24)])])}const m=o(r,[["render",a]]);export{h as __pageData,m as default};
