If two browser tabs of the same address are open, an error occurs because the <code>IndexedDB</code> connection cannot be closed when logging out of one of them.</strong></p><h2 id="environment-and-deployment" tabindex="-1">Environment and Deployment <a class="header-anchor" href="#environment-and-deployment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Environment and Deployment&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="q-why-does-the-production-environment-loading-wasm-failure" tabindex="-1">Q: Why does the production environment loading Wasm failure? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-why-does-the-production-environment-loading-wasm-failure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Why does the production environment loading Wasm failure?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>A: This is usually because the server has not been configured with the correct MIME type.</strong> The TechUI core relies on <code>.wasm</code> files. If your web server (Nginx/Apache/IIS) does not set the <code>Content-Type</code> for <code>.wasm</code> files to <code>application/wasm</code>, the browser will refuse to load them due to security policies.</p><p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Nginx</strong>: Add the following to <code>mime.types</code> or your configuration:</li></ul><div class="language-nginx vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">nginx</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">types</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;"> {</span></span>

For example, use the <code>&lt;client-only&gt;</code> tag in Nuxt, or use <code>next/dynamic</code> with SSR disabled in Next.js.</p><h3 id="q-why-does-the-console-show-error-after-deployment" tabindex="-1">Q: Why does the console show error after deployment? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-why-does-the-console-show-error-after-deployment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Why does the console show error after deployment?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>A: This is an integrity verification failure caused by CDN caching.</strong> The Wasm core has a strict integrity self-check mechanism. If you update the version but the CDN still caches the old <code>.wasm</code> file, the JS loader will not match the Wasm binary fingerprint. <strong>Suggestion:</strong> Configure the server to disable caching for <code>.wasm</code> files or ensure the build filenames include a Hash value.</p><h2 id="authorization-and-keys" tabindex="-1">Authorization and Keys <a class="header-anchor" href="#authorization-and-keys" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Authorization and Keys&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="q-is-it-safe-to-write-the-license-key-directly-in-the-frontend-code" tabindex="-1">Q: Is it safe to write the License Key directly in the frontend code? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-is-it-safe-to-write-the-license-key-directly-in-the-frontend-code" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Is it safe to write the License Key directly in the frontend code?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>A: It is relatively safe.</strong> TechUI adopts a <strong>&quot;Zero Trust&quot;</strong> verification architecture.</p><ol><li><strong>Impossible to hide</strong>: As a pure frontend solution, the Key must be exposed in the code.</li><li><strong>Difficult to exploit</strong>: The Key itself is only an encrypted credential. Without the private key algorithm inside the Wasm module, an attacker cannot generate new authorizations or decrypt core functions even if they obtain the Key.</li></ol><p>Furthermore, if your instance is deployed to a public network environment, it is recommended to contact an administrator to bind the license to a domain. In this case, leaking the Key will not lead to abuse.</p><p>By default, <strong>domain binding</strong> or <strong>local-only deployment restrictions</strong> are not enabled for licenses.</p><h3 id="q-what-happens-when-a-development-license-expires" tabindex="-1">Q: What happens when a Development License expires? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-happens-when-a-development-license-expires" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What happens when a Development License expires?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>A: The system will trigger a fuse.</strong> If you are using a development license, please pay close attention to the console prompt: <code>[XX] days until expiration</code>.</p><h2 id="development-and-integration" tabindex="-1">Development and Integration <a class="header-anchor" href="#development-and-integration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Development and Integration&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="q-why-is-on-demand-import-tree-shaking-not-supported" tabindex="-1">Q: Why is on-demand import (Tree-shaking) not supported? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-why-is-on-demand-import-tree-shaking-not-supported" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Why is on-demand import (Tree-shaking) not supported?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>A: This is a trade-off between architecture and security.</strong> The core of TechUI is a complete Wasm binary module that cannot be split like JS code. Additionally, full packaging is used to protect core algorithms from reverse engineering. For details, please refer to the <strong>[No Support for On-Demand Import]</strong> section.</p><h3 id="q-can-i-use-both-base-and-scifi-libraries-at-the-same-time" tabindex="-1">Q: Can I use both Base and Scifi libraries at the same time? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-can-i-use-both-base-and-scifi-libraries-at-the-same-time" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Can I use both Base and Scifi libraries at the same time?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>A: No.</strong> Following the <strong>&quot;Single Core Principle,&quot;</strong> it is strictly forbidden to introduce multiple TechUI core libraries into the same project, as this will cause Wasm context conflicts. If you need the functions of both, please upgrade to <strong>Prime Edition</strong>.</p><h2 id="business-and-compliance" tabindex="-1">Business and Compliance <a class="header-anchor" href="#business-and-compliance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Business and Compliance&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="q-i-purchased-a-commercial-license-can-i-distribute-it-to-my-customers" tabindex="-1">Q: I purchased a commercial license; can I distribute it to my customers? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-i-purchased-a-commercial-license-can-i-distribute-it-to-my-customers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: I purchased a commercial license; can I distribute it to my customers?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>A: Yes, but you must follow sub-license rules.</strong> Commercial licenses include commercial distribution rights. You need to generate an independent <strong>Sub-License</strong> for each customer project you deliver via the TechUI developer backend. It is strictly forbidden to give your Master Key directly to customers.</p><p><strong>B: For other licenses, please purchase and generate the license in the customer&#39;s name.</strong></p><p><strong>C: The free version has no restrictions and can be distributed freely.</strong></p><h3 id="q-why-is-it-unavailable-in-certain-countries" tabindex="-1">Q: Why is it unavailable in certain countries? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-why-is-it-unavailable-in-certain-countries" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Why is it unavailable in certain countries?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>A: Geofencing restrictions.</strong> Based on compliance and anti-fraud policies, we have restricted specific regions such as Myanmar and Cambodia.
